# Simple-Java-Snake

This was my attempt at making an upgraded version of a snake game that I used for a school project. 
It accepts keyboard inputs, up/down/left/right for snake control and menu navigation, P for pause.

Scores are stored in the score.txt file, only the top 10 scores are stored.

Files: 
- Game.jar, the game itself
- score.txt, text file for storing scores
- Game.java, source code
